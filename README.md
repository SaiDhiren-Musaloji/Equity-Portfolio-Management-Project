# Equity-Portfolio-Management-Project

## Project Description
This project provides an in-depth analysis of stock price data using Python. By leveraging libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`, the notebook showcases methodologies to analyze trends, visualize data, and predict stock behavior over time. This analysis is designed to help financial analysts, traders, and researchers gain better insights into market performance.

   - Formats and standardizes timestamps for easier manipulation.

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Generates insightful charts and graphs such as:
     - Line graphs for stock trends.
     - Volume traded bar charts.
     - Moving average overlays for smoothing trends.

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Computes key metrics like mean, variance, and standard deviation.
   - Analyzes historical trends to identify patterns.

4. **Predictive Insights**
   - Implements basic predictive models for future price trends.
   - Explores moving averages and momentum indicators.
